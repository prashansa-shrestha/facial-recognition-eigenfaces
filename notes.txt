Facial Recognition System using Eigenfaces, and Classification of faces based on reduced features

This task also emphasizes on increasing the efficiency of the system.
This will be done using eigenfaces that alllow reduction of the dimensions of the images, while retaining key features.

Procudeure:
The LFW(Labeled faces in the wild) dataset has been used to build the facial recognition system.
Eigenfaces of the dataset has been computed as below:
>The covariance matrix of the image data was constructed
>The eigenvectors corresponding to
